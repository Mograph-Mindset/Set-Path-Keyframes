This script quickly Adds or Deletes Keyframes for all Path Properties on selected Shape Layers at the current time indicator.

1. Create new keyframes for all Path properties on the selected layers at the current time
2. If all Path properties at the current time already have keyframes, remove those keyframes
3. Map to any Keyboard Shortcut (ex: ⌥+SHIFT+Q or CTRL+ALT+Q)

The full plugin on aescripts wraps the script code in C++, and adds a new menu item to the After Effects Animation menu:
• Set Path Keyframes

1.0 - Initial Release
